# JavaScript-Hands-on
19 February 2026

This repository contains my hands-on exercises for learning basic web programming using HTML and JavaScript.

The main objective of these exercises is to understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements, particularly in dynamically creating components such as textareas, buttons, and containers.

All examples were developed using Visual Studio Code with the Live Server extension.
